# 🕵🏾 recon
This script weaponizes the power of web scraping to collect assets from the Apple bug bounty program's acknowledgements page.
Since Apple's program doesn't have a well defined scope, the assets collected here can be used as a point of reference to perform further testing or, recon.

# Update
As of November 2022, Apple has changed their security acknowledgements page. Mentions of vulnerable hosts are removed in latest versions of the security acknowledgement pages. As such, this tool is not working anymore.

# ⚒️ Install
Make sure you have Node and npm installed. Then run,
```npm install```
to install the dependencies

If you just want the file containing the assets (domains and sub-domains), simply run

```wget https://github.com/payloadartist/recon/raw/main/assets.txt```

# ⚙️ Usage

To pull new assets on your own.

Run
```chmod +x extract.js``` (for the first time or you can skip this if you run with node)

```./extract.js assets.txt```
(default output file is ```apple_assets.txt``` while you can specify a custom output file by providing the second argument)

It will also output to stdout, for piping to other tools.
